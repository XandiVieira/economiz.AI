/**
 * Fills catalog gaps on demand: for barcodes our imported catalog can't yet
 * categorize, it queries the live OFF-family API ({@link OpenFoodFactsApiClient})
 * and caches-through the result, so the next lookup (and every future receipt
 * with that product) resolves locally.
 *
 * <p>Called from the UNTRANSACTED ingestion phase ({@code ReceiptIngestionService},
 * after parse, before persist) — the HTTP calls must never run inside a DB
 * transaction, and must never break ingest, so this is strictly best-effort.
 *
 * <p><b>Latency:</b> lookups run with bounded concurrency ({@link #FETCH_CONCURRENCY})
 * so a 20-new-item receipt costs ~a few seconds, not ~20. A scanned receipt is
 * always enriched in full — there is no per-receipt lookup cap; the OFF API is
 * free, and concurrency (not a count cap) is what keeps us within fair-use.
 * <b>Waste:</b> every
 * attempted barcode is written back tagged {@link EanCatalogSource#LIVE_API} —
 * even when the API didn't know it or had no category — so it's marked "checked"
 * and never re-queried on a later purchase.
