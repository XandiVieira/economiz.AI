/**
 * Single decision point for whether a merchant's receipts are accepted and
 * whether they feed the collaborative price index. The rule is recurring
 * food/essentials RETAIL vs one-off food SERVICE:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code SUPPORTED} — retail segments (supermarket, pharmacy, food
 *       retail) or an admin SUPPORTED override: full ingest + price index.</li>
 *   <li>{@code BLOCKED} — food service (restaurantes/bares) or an admin
 *       BLOCKED override: the scan is rejected with a localized message and
 *       nothing beyond a failed tombstone is stored.</li>
 *   <li>{@code GREY} — everything else (OTHER, or UNKNOWN while the CNAE
 *       lookup hasn't succeeded): ingested normally so the user gets their
 *       result, but held OUT of the collaborative index until an admin
 *       reviews the sighting and promotes or blocks the merchant.</li>
