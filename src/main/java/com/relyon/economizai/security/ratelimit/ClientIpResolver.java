 * Resolves the originating client IP for rate-limit keying. We sit behind
 * Cloudflare (tunnel/worker), so the immediate {@code remoteAddr} is the
 * proxy's IP — useless for limiting.
 *
 * <p>Header trust matters here: {@code X-Forwarded-For} is client-appendable,
 * so its FIRST entry is attacker-controlled (a spoofed random value per request
 * would defeat IP rate limiting entirely). We therefore prefer
 * {@code CF-Connecting-IP}, which Cloudflare overwrites with the IP it
 * actually saw, and otherwise take the LAST {@code X-Forwarded-For} hop — the
 * one appended by the trusted proxy in front of us, not by the client.
