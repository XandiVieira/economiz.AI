 * Tracks where a Product's category/genericName came from. Used for:

 * - Auto-promotion (LEARNED_DICTIONARY entries come from stable ML
 *   predictions promoted by AutoPromotionService).
 * - Audit ("why is this product categorized as X?").
 * - Reset targeting: CONSENSUS products can be reverted to NONE by
 *   the admin reset-consensus endpoint, leaving USER/DICTIONARY intact.
